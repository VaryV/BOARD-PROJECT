# BOARD PROJECT Std XII

## TO DO LIST

My Class XII Board Project.

This is a simple To-Do List that uses python and a library named tkinter for the user interface and MySQL database to store information about the users and their tasks added.
It is a simple desktop application that can help you set due dates for tasks add, delete and edit tasks.
It has a python program that runs in the background constantly that checks the time against tasks in the MySQL database and sounds an alarm at the right time.
